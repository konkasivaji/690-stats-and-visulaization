# Education
Education Considered an Economic Good? One of the most effective ways to fight poverty and inequality is through education and it tends to raise productivity and creativity, as well as stimulate entrepreneurship and technological breakthroughs. All of these factors lead to greater output and good economic growth. Developing countries have made tremendous progress in getting children into the classroom and more children worldwide are now in school. But learning is not guaranteed.
## Why is it important to you and/or to others?
Education helps a person to learn more about the world and improve confidence. It can help you improve in your career and your personal growth. Through education economic growth is enhanced when equal education and labor opportunities are available across gender, race, age, and employment possibilities.
